The local_scripts folder holds base copies from scripts that are meant
to be customized at each location. These scripts are copied by the 
fabfile deployment tool to the correct location, usually with some 
customization (path substitution, username substitution, etc.).

The copies in this folder are the base files, and are stored with the 
repository. They are ignored in their locations for development or
production:

local_settings.py    included in the Django settings file. Should be
                     copied to the $VDELIHOME/cdnmanager/cdnmanager/cdn
                     directory (where the settings.py file is). 
                     Localization: directories and username.

ftpserver            Bash script, takes care of setting the correct 
                     environment for the ftpserver.py script to run
                     under sudo. Copied to $VDELIHOME/ftpserver dir.
